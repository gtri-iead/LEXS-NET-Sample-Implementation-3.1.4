1. INTRODUCTION

This distribution contains sample implementations of LEXS Web 
Services using the latest service oriented technologies under 
windows Communications Foundation (WCF) application programming
interface (API) in the .NET Framework. There is a sample 
implementation for each Search-Retrieve and Publish-Discover
schemas. Each sample implementation includes a web service 
library, a console application to self-host the service, a WCF
library to host the service in IIS, a console-based client, and 
a console-based contract and proxy code generation application 
based on the Wscf.Blue open-source project.

The distribution includes Visual Studio 2010 solutions with 
the service, client, and code generator organized as follows:

-----------------------------------------------------------------
LEXS Search-Retrieve Solution ..................................
   LexsSearchRetrieveCommon - Shared code project ..............
   LexsSearchRetrieveWebService - Web Service project ..........
   LexsSRClientProxyApp - Client Proxy project .................
   LexsSRWebServiceHost - WCF library for hosting in IIS .......
   LexsSRWebServiceHostApp - Console app. for self-hosting .....
   XmlSerializationUtils - XML serialization utilities .........


LEXS Publish-Discover Solution .................................
   LexsPublishDiscoverCommon - Shared code project .............
   LexsPublishDiscoverWebService - Web Service project .........
   LexsPublishDiscoverClient - Client Proxy project ............
   LexsPDWebServiceHost - WCF library for hosting in IIS .......
   LexsPDWebServiceHostApp - Console app. for self-hosting .....
   XmlSerializationUtils - XML serialization utilities .........

-----------------------------------------------------------------

In addition, it includes the following components:

-----------------------------------------------------------------
LEXS3.1.4 - includes the wsdl and schema files that define the 
   data, message, and service contracts for the LEXS IEPD 
   implemented. 
GenerateServiceAndProxyCode - includes the application and batch 
   files to generat service and client proxy code. Generated 
   code will be stored in the Service and Client Proxy folders.

2. ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

The LEXS WS was implemented using Visual Studio 2010 and the 
.NET Framework version 4.0. The service and client proxy 
components are built as independent projects and can be used 
separately.


2.1 WCF Service

The web service was implemented as a WCF service library which
results in a DLL that can be easily deployed. For this project, 
code was first generated with the WscfGen application (from 
the CodeGenerationTool solution) using the 
GenerateServiceCode.bat file (see the GenerateServiceAndProxyCode 
folder). The data and service contracts are included in the 
LexsSearchRetrieveCommon project. The service implementation, 
service (svc) and configuration (App.config) files are included 
in the LexsSRWebServiceHost or LexsPDWebServiceHost project for 
hosting in IIS. 


2.2 WCF Client

The client project includes the client code to generate the 
proxy programmatically based on an endpoint address defined in
the configuration file. This project references the service
and data contracts defined in the LexsPublishDiscoverCommon or 
LexsSearchRetrieveCommon projects.


2.3 Hosting

2.3.1 Hosting in IIS
This WCF service is hosted in IIS 7. Create a new website in IIS 
and use Visual Studio's Publish feature to deploy the web service 
library into the website's folder. Publishing results in the 
service DLL being copied (along with PDB files if in debug mode) 
into the website's bin directory. Service (.svc) and Web.Config 
files are also copied. Test the service using the following 
(where the 8010 and 8020 port numbers are arbitrary number 
assigned when creating the Search-Retrieve and Publish-Discovery
websites respectively):


http://localhost:8010/LEXSSearchRetrievePortType.svc

or 

http://localhost:8020/LEXSPublishDiscoverPortType.svc


2.3.2 Self-Hosting
The solution includes the LexsPDWebServiceHostApp console 
application project that when executed hosts the service. This 
simpifies testing the client/service interaction.
