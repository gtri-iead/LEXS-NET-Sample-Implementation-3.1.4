   -CHANGELOG.txt change log from previous releases.
   
   -NIEM 2.0 subset
    Location: xsd/niem and xsd/niem-constrained
    Documents validated against LEXS NIEM subset will always be valid in NIEM. 
    Subset also uniquely identifies the structure of the base elements which will 
    be used for information exchange. The namespace of LEXS NIEM subset is the 
    same as NIEM.  
    Subset can be recreated via NIEM SSGT using supplied wantlist.xml ( see below ).
    Prior to LEXS 3.1.4 only niem-constrained NIEM subset included constraints. 
    However, after LEXS 3.1.4 both subsets contain constrained NIEM schema.
        
   -NIEM 2.0 subset "wantlist"
    Location: xsd/wantlist.xml
    Configuration file used by NIEM SSGT to generate LEXS NIEM subset.
    (wantlist.xml embeds all NIEM subset restrictions, LEXS 3.1.4 and later).
    
   -LEXS organizational schemas
    Location:
        /* LEXS Publish/Discover and Search/Retrieve schemas */    
        xsd/publish-discover/3.1/publish-discover.xsd
        xsd/search-retrieve/3.1/search-retrieve.xsd
        /* LEXS 3.1 */
        xsd/codes/3.1/codes.xsd
        xsd/digest/3.1/digest.xsd
        xsd/library/3.1/library.xsd
        xsd/lexs/3.1/lexs.xsd
    Schema(s) identify the structure of the message for information exchange between participants.

Notes:
	LEXS specification (versions greater than 3.1.4) includes non-normative getDomainRequest/getDomainResponse messages with corresponding schema types.
	Those messages could be used for out-of-bound non LEXS conformant information exchanges between systems.
	Use of those structures by no means classifies any system as LEXS conformant and should be reserved only for functionality not supported by LEXS.
